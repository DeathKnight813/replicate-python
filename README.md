# Replicate Python client

This is a Python client for [Replicate](https://replicate.com). It lets you run models from your Python code or Jupyter notebook, and do various other things on Replicate.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+

## Install

```sh
pip install replicate
```

## Authenticate

Before running any Python scripts that use the API, you need to set your Replicate API token in your environment.

Grab your token from [replicate.com/account](https://replicate.com/account) and set it as an environment variable:

```
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<your token>
```

We recommend not adding the token directly to your source code, because you don't want to put your credentials in source control. If anyone used your API key, their usage would be charged to your account.

## Run a model

Create a new Python file and add the following code:

```python
>>> import replicate
>>> replicate.run(
        "stability-ai/stable-diffusion:27b93a2413e7f36cd83da926f3656280b2931564ff050bf9575f1fdf9bcd7478",
        input={"prompt": "a 19th century portrait of a wombat gentleman"}
    )

['https://replicate.com/api/models/stability-ai/stable-diffusion/files/50fcac81-865d-499e-81ac-49de0cb79264/out-0.png']
```

Some models, like [methexis-inc/img2prompt](https://replicate.com/methexis-inc/img2prompt), receive images as inputs. To pass a file as an input, use a file handle or URL:

```python
>>> output = replicate.run(
        "salesforce/blip:2e1dddc8621f72155f24cf2e0adbde548458d3cab9f00c0139eea840d0ac4746",
        input={"image": open("path/to/mystery.jpg", "rb")},
    )

"an astronaut riding a horse"
```

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use the Replicate client asynchronously by prepending `async_` to the method name. 
> 
> Here's an example of how to run several predictions concurrently and wait for them all to complete:
>
> ```python
> import asyncio
> import replicate
> 
> # https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl
> model_version = "stability-ai/sdxl:39ed52f2a78e934b3ba6e2a89f5b1c712de7dfea535525255b1aa35c5565e08b"
> prompts = [
>     f"A chariot pulled by a team of {count} rainbow unicorns"
>     for count in ["two", "four", "six", "eight"]
> ]
>
> async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
>     tasks = [
>         tg.create_task(replicate.async_run(model_version, input={"prompt": prompt}))
>         for prompt in prompts
>     ]
>
> results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
> print(results)
> ```

## Run a model and stream its output

Replicateâ€™s API supports server-sent event streams (SSEs) for language models. 
Use the `stream` method to consume tokens as they're produced by the model.

```python
import replicate

# https://replicate.com/meta/llama-2-70b-chat
model_version = "meta/llama-2-70b-chat:02e509c789964a7ea8736978a43525956ef40397be9033abf9fd2badfe68c9e3"

tokens = []
for event in replicate.stream(
    model_version,
    input={
        "prompt": "Please write a haiku about llamas.",
    },
):
    print(event)
    tokens.append(str(event))

print("".join(tokens))
```

For more information, see
["Streaming output"](https://replicate.com/docs/streaming) in Replicate's docs.


## Run a model in the background

You can start a model and run it in the background:

```python
>>> model = replicate.models.get("kvfrans/clipdraw")
>>> version = model.versions.get("5797a99edc939ea0e9242d5e8c9cb3bc7d125b1eac21bda852e5cb79ede2cd9b")
>>> prediction = replicate.predictions.create(
    version=version,
    input={"prompt":"Watercolor painting of an underwater submarine"})

>>> prediction
Prediction(...)

>>> prediction.status
'starting'

>>> dict(prediction)
{"id": "...", "status": "starting", ...}

>>> prediction.reload()
>>> prediction.status
'processing'

>>> print(prediction.logs)
iteration: 0, render:loss: -0.6171875
iteration: 10, render:loss: -0.92236328125
iteration: 20, render:loss: -1.197265625
iteration: 30, render:loss: -1.3994140625

>>> prediction.wait()

>>> prediction.status
'succeeded'

>>> prediction.output
'https://.../output.png'
```

## Run a model in the background and get a webhook

You can run a model and get a webhook when it completes, instead of waiting for it to finish:

```python
model = replicate.models.get("ai-forever/kandinsky-2.2")
version = model.versions.get("ea1addaab376f4dc227f5368bbd8eff901820fd1cc14ed8cad63b29249e9d463")
prediction = replicate.predictions.create(
    version=version,
    input={"prompt":"Watercolor painting of an underwater submarine"},
    webhook="https://example.com/your-webhook",
    webhook_events_filter=["completed"]
)
```

For details on receiving webhooks, see [replicate.com/docs/webhooks](https://replicate.com/docs/webhooks).

## Compose models into a pipeline

You can run a model and feed the output into another model:

```python
laionide = replicate.models.get("afiaka87/laionide-v4").versions.get("b21cbe271e65c1718f2999b038c18b45e21e4fba961181fbfae9342fc53b9e05")
swinir = replicate.models.get("jingyunliang/swinir").versions.get("660d922d33153019e8c263a3bba265de882e7f4f70396546b6c9c8f9d47a021a")
image = laionide.predict(prompt="avocado armchair")
upscaled_image = swinir.predict(image=image)
```

## Get output from a running model

Run a model and get its output while it's running:

```python
iterator = replicate.run(
    "pixray/text2image:5c347a4bfa1d4523a58ae614c2194e15f2ae682b57e3797a5bb468920aa70ebf",
    input={"prompts": "san francisco sunset"}
)

for image in iterator:
    display(image)
```

## Cancel a prediction

You can cancel a running prediction:

```python
>>> model = replicate.models.get("kvfrans/clipdraw")
>>> version = model.versions.get("5797a99edc939ea0e9242d5e8c9cb3bc7d125b1eac21bda852e5cb79ede2cd9b")
>>> prediction = replicate.predictions.create(
        version=version,
        input={"prompt":"Watercolor painting of an underwater submarine"}
    )

>>> prediction.status
'starting'

>>> prediction.cancel()

>>> prediction.reload()
>>> prediction.status
'canceled'
```

## List predictions

You can list all the predictions you've run:

```python
replicate.predictions.list()
# [<Prediction: 8b0ba5ab4d85>, <Prediction: 494900564e8c>]
```

Lists of predictions are paginated. You can get the next page of predictions by passing the `next` property as an argument to the `list` method:

```python
page1 = replicate.predictions.list()

if page1.next:
    page2 = replicate.predictions.list(page1.next)
```

## Load output files

Output files are returned as HTTPS URLs. You can load an output file as a buffer:

```python
import replicate
from urllib.request import urlretrieve

model = replicate.models.get("stability-ai/stable-diffusion")
version = model.versions.get("27b93a2413e7f36cd83da926f3656280b2931564ff050bf9575f1fdf9bcd7478")
out = version.predict(prompt="wavy colorful abstract patterns, cgsociety")
urlretrieve(out[0], "/tmp/out.png")
background = Image.open("/tmp/out.png")
```

## List models

You can the models you've created:

```python
replicate.models.list()
```

Lists of models are paginated. You can get the next page of models by passing the `next` property as an argument to the `list` method, or you can use the `paginate` method to fetch pages automatically.

```python
# Automatic pagination using `replicate.paginate` (recommended)
models = []
for page in replicate.paginate(replicate.models.list):
    models.extend(page.results)
    if len(models) > 100:
        break

# Manual pagination using `next` cursors
page = replicate.models.list()
while page:
    models.extend(page.results)
    if len(models) > 100:
          break
    page = replicate.models.list(page.next) if page.next else None
```

You can also find collections of featured models on Replicate:

```python
>>> collections = [collection for page in replicate.paginate(replicate.collections.list) for collection in page]
>>> collections[0].slug
"vision-models"
>>> collections[0].description
"Multimodal large language models with vision capabilities like object detection and optical character recognition (OCR)"

>>> replicate.collections.get("text-to-image").models
[<Model: stability-ai/sdxl>, ...]
```

## Create a model

You can create a model for a user or organization
with a given name, visibility, and hardware SKU:

```python
import replicate

model = replicate.models.create(
    owner="your-username",
    name="my-model",
    visibility="public",
    hardware="gpu-a40-large"
)
```

Here's how to list of all the available hardware for running models on Replicate:

```python
>>> [hw.sku for hw in replicate.hardware.list()]
['cpu', 'gpu-t4', 'gpu-a40-small', 'gpu-a40-large']
```
